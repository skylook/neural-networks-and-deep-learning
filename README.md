# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" (Python 3.x version)

This repository contains code samples for my (forthcoming) book on
"Neural Networks and Deep Learning".

As the code is written to accompany the book, I don't intend to add
new features.  However, bug reports are welcome, and you should feel
free to fork and modify the code.

## Changes
This is the code for online book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning". But it is modified for Python 3.x.
If you are interested in that book but only prefer to python 3, you can use this version.
